# Pomodoro-Timer-React
Pomodoro Timer in React

## TODO
* Use the same variable for input name and ID. No reason we need two different unique strings per input
* Get session/break text to change when the new session/break starts and not when the previous one reaches 0
* Fix bug with 60 seconds showing on timer start (e.g.00:25:60 with default settings)
* Fix bug with session/break length not changing when test mode turned off
* Document why I did the a11y on the length controls the way I did (couldn't find confimation that any particular way of doing this is widely understood/usable by users and well supported across browsers/AT)
